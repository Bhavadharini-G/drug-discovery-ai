## 📌 Project Overview

The Drug Discovery & Disease Monitoring AI System is a unified AI-driven biomedical intelligence platform that integrates drug discovery and disease monitoring into a single end-to-end workflow.

The system enables researchers to explore disease mechanisms, prioritize disease-associated gene targets, evaluate drug-like compounds, and analyze biomedical research trends using modern AI, bioinformatics, and graph-based learning techniques.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional drug discovery and disease analysis pipelines are often:
- Time-consuming and fragmented across tools  
- Difficult to interpret due to massive biomedical datasets  
- Lacking integrated, evidence-based decision support  

This project addresses these challenges by combining literature mining, graph learning, pathway analysis, compound scoring, and structural validation into one unified workflow.

## 🧬 Molecular Docking 

This project includes a complete structure-based molecular docking pipeline using AutoDock Vina and PyMOL to validate AI-prioritized drug–target interactions.

## 🧪 Tools Used for Molecular Docking

The structure-based molecular docking component of this project utilizes the following tools to ensure accurate preparation, execution, and visualization of protein–ligand interactions:

### 🔹 AutoDockTools (ADT)
- Used for **protein and ligand preparation**
- Removal of water molecules
- Addition of polar hydrogens and charges
- Conversion of structures to **PDBQT** format
- Grid box definition and extraction of docking parameters

### 🔹 AutoDock Vina
- Used for **molecular docking simulation**
- Efficient scoring and pose generation
- Provides binding affinity values (ΔG in kcal/mol)
- Supports multiple docking modes for pose comparison

### 🔹 Open Babel
- Used for **ligand format conversion**
- Conversion from SDF/MOL formats to PDB/PDBQT
- Generation of 3D coordinates and explicit hydrogens

### 🔹 PyMOL
- Used for **visualization and analysis**
- Visualization of docked protein–ligand complexes
- Splitting and inspection of multiple docking poses
- Generation of publication-quality figures

### 🔹 AlphaFold / PDB
- Source of **protein 3D structures**
- Used as receptor input for docking studies

Together, these tools form a complete and reproducible molecular docking workflow that complements the AI-driven drug discovery pipeline with structure-based validation.

## 🧬 Molecular Docking Procedure (End-to-End)

Docking folder structure:
Docking_files/
- protein/protein.pdbqt  
- Ligand/ligand.pdbqt  
- config.txt  
- vina.exe  
- out.pdbqt  

Protein preparation:
- Protein structure obtained from AlphaFold or PDB  
- Water molecules removed  
- Polar hydrogens and charges added  
- Saved as protein.pdbqt  

Ligand preparation:
- Ligand retrieved from PubChem or ChEMBL  
- Converted to 3D structure  
- Hydrogens and Gasteiger charges added  
- Saved as ligand.pdbqt  

Grid box definition:
- Binding site defined using AutoDockTools  
- Grid center and size reused for Vina docking  

Vina configuration (config.txt):
- Fixed config.txt requirements

receptor = protein/protein.pdbqt  
ligand = Ligand/ligand.pdbqt  
center_x = X  
center_y = Y  
center_z = Z  
size_x = 22.5  
size_y = 22.5  
size_z = 22.5  
exhaustiveness = 8  
num_modes = 9  
energy_range = 3  

Run docking:
1. vina.exe --config config.txt --out out.pdbqt
2. vina.exe --config config.txt --out out.pdbqt > vina log 


Docking results:
- Binding affinity (ΔG, kcal/mol) printed in terminal  
- Most negative score indicates strongest binding  
- Mode 1 corresponds to the best docking pose  

Visualization in PyMOL:
- load protein/protein.pdbqt  
- load out.pdbqt  
- split_states out  
- enable protein and out_0001  
- protein shown as cartoon, ligand as sticks
